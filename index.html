            <h1>Suez Canal</h1>
            <p>
              The Suez Canal is an artificial waterway that connects the
              Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea through the Isthmus of Suez in
              Egypt. It is one of the most important trade routes in the world,
              as it allows ships to travel between Europe and Asia without going
              around Africa. The canal was built by a French company between
              1859 and 1869, and was later nationalized by Egypt in 1956. The
              canal is about 193 km (120 miles) long and has no locks. It can
              accommodate ships with a maximum draft of 20.1 m (66 ft) and a
              maximum beam of 77.5 m (254 ft). The canal is operated and
              maintained by the Suez Canal Authority, a state-owned entity of
              Egypt.

            In 1870, the canal`s first full year of operation, there were 486
            transits, or fewer than 2 per day. In 1966 there were 21,250, an
            average of 58 per day, with net tonnage increasing from some 444,000
            metric tons (437,000 long tons) in 1870 to about 278,400,000 metric
            tons (274,000,000 long tons). By the mid-1980s the number of daily
            transits had fallen to an average of 50, but net annual tonnage was
            about 355,600,000 metric tons (350,000,000 long tons). In 2018 there
            were 18,174 transits with a net annual tonnage of about
            1,139,630,000 metric tons (1,121,163,000 long tons). The original
            canal did not permit two-way traffic, and ships would stop in a
            passing bay to allow the passage of ships in the other direction.
            Transit time then averaged 40 hours, but by 1939 it had been reduced
            to 13 hours. A system of convoys was adopted in 1947, consisting of
            one northbound and two southbound per day. Transit time went up to
            15 hours in 1967 despite convoying, reflecting the great growth in
            tanker traffic at that time. With some enlargement of the canal,
            transit time since 1975 has ranged from 11 to 16 hours. Upon
            entering the canal at Port Said or Suez, ships are assessed for
            tonnage and cargo (passengers have ridden without charge since 1950)
            and are handled by one or two pilots for actual canal transit, which
            is increasingly controlled by radar. Southbound convoys moor at Port
            Said, Al-Ballāḥ, Lake Timsah, and Al-Kabrīt, where there are
            bypasses that allow northbound convoys to proceed without stopping.
            In August 2015 a new 35-km (22-mile) expansion running parallel to
            the main channel was opened, enabling two-way transit through the
            canal. The main channel was deepened to allow for the passage of
            larger ships. The expansion project, launched by Egyptian President
            Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in 2014, was part of an effort to boost Egypt’s
            economy. The nature of traffic has greatly altered, especially
            because of the enormous growth in shipments of crude oil and
            petroleum products from the Persian Gulf since 1950. In 1913 the oil
            in northbound traffic amounted to 295,700 metric tons (291,000 long
            tons), whereas in 1966 it amounted to 168,700,000 metric tons
            (166,000,000 long tons). The closure of the canal from 1967 to 1975
            led to the use of large oil tankers on the route around the Cape of
            Good Hope and prompted the development of the Sumed pipeline from
            Suez to Alexandria, which opened in 1977. Since 1975 the increased
            size of tankers—the largest of which cannot use the canal—and the
            development of sources of crude oil in areas outside of the canal
            route (e.g., Algeria, Libya, Nigeria, the North Sea, and Mexico)
            have reduced the canal’s importance in the international oil trade.

            Egypt. From an all-time peak of 984,000 in 1945, passenger traffic
            has declined to negligible numbers because of the competition from
            aircraft. Further decline in canal traffic resulted from a shift of
            Australasian trade from Europe to Japan and East Asia. Some movement
            of oil, however, from refineries in Russia, southern Europe, and
            Algeria has continued, chiefly to India, and the shipment of dry
            cargoes, including grain, ores, and metals, has increased. A more
            recent feature has been the growth of container and roll-on/roll-off
            (ro-ro) traffic through the canal, chiefly destined for the highly
            congested ports of the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. The major
            northbound cargoes consist of crude petroleum and petroleum
            products, coal, ores and metals, and fabricated metals, as well as
            wood, oilseeds and oilseed cake, and cereals. Southbound traffic
            consists of cement, fertilizers, fabricated metals, cereals, and
            empty oil tankers. Communications and towns Port Said: Suez Canal

            canal led to the growth of settlements in what had been, except for
            Suez, almost uninhabited arid territory. More than 28,000 hectares
            (70,000 acres) were brought under cultivation, and about 8 percent
            of the total population was engaged in agriculture, with
            approximately 10,000 commercial and industrial activities of various
            sizes. During the Suez Crisis in 1967, almost all the population was
            evacuated, and most of the settlements were severely damaged or
            destroyed during subsequent warfare. With the reopening of the canal
            in 1975, however, reconstruction of the area was begun, and most of
            the population had returned by 1978. Port Said was made a
            customs-free zone in 1975, and tax-free industrial zones have been
            established along the canal. The major urban centres are Port Said,
            with its east-bank counterpart, Būr Fuʾād; Ismailia
            (Al-Ismāʿīliyyah), on the north shore of Lake Timsah; and Suez, with
            its west-bank outport, Būr Tawfīq. Water for irrigation and for
            domestic and industrial use is supplied by the Nile via the
            Al-Ismāʿīliyyah Canal. There are two roads from the pre-1967 period
            on the west bank. Ferries have largely been replaced by four
            underpasses: north of Suez, south and north of Lake Timsah, and at
            Al-Qanṭarah. From this last, a road continues along the east bank to
            Būr Fuʾād, and another runs eastward through the Sinai to Israel.
            Newer roads on the east bank run eastward to the Khutmiyyah, Giddi,
            and Mitla passes, which give access to the central Sinai. The
            railway on the west side of the canal was restored in the 1970s. In
            1980 the Ahmad Hamdi road tunnel was opened, connecting Egypt proper
            with its governorate (muḥāfaẓah) of Shamāl Sīnāʾ. About 1.6 km (1
            mile) of the tunnel passes beneath the canal itself. As part of the
            2014 expansion project, the Egyptian government built additional
            tunnels that run beneath the canal, which were opened in May 2019.
            The expansion project also includes the development of additional
            transportation infrastructure in the surrounding area, aims to
            reclaim some 1.6 million hectares (4 million acres) of land for
            cultivation, and plans to develop a sprawling free-trade zone along
            the canal.
